This application converts txt files into .csv files.
This application allows the upload of a .zip file with a folder containing .txt files that have a known format of 

## Line 1 - Contains the title of the article.
## Line 2 - EOF contains the body of the article.

The goal of this application is to create a combined .csv file of all the article files in the folder so that the .csv file can be upoaded into a cms such as Drupal or WordPress if the cms has a module or plugin that can accept a .csv file as input and convert them to articles or posts in the blog.

Work is in progress to meld various article formats which can be imported to match the various PLR library article formts one can find.

Work is being done to allow the direct import of the files into Drupal Article Nodes and skip the conversion of the .txt file into .csv file that then would need to be manually uploaded via a csv importer Module or Plugin.

Different extensible format engines are being developed to allow a number of PLR formats to be imported and converted to Article Nodes in Drupal and Posts in WordPress and 
HUGO Markdown Post formats.

This project is looking for development contributors and funding sponsors to help continue the development of it.

It is based on the LAMP stack and the CMS system that run on the LAMP stack as well as HUGO and REACT based web sites.

This project will eventually allow the upload of a nested folder structure of topical folder names which contain articles which would be taged as the name of the folder for taxonomi and catagory classification.

Eventually the application will be released into the Druapl Marketplace for Modules and the WordPress Plugin Directory as well as from here in Git Hub.
